Learning to use AngularJS in a professional project.

Create the AngularJS version of "D3.JS application" that displayes the "pack" of some data. "pack" is a d3.js terminology.

`<!DOCTYPE html>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<style>

text {
  font: 10px sans-serif;
}

</style>
<body>
  <button id="bubble-data" class="btn btn-primary btn-block">Drill Down</button>
<script src="public/bower_components/d3/d3.min.js"></script>
<script src="public/js/external.js"></script>
</body>`
